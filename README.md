# Omniscient Personal Assistant (OPA) Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Omniscient Personal Assistant (OPA)
- **Purpose**: To provide users with a smart, AI-driven mobile assistant that automates phone tasks and serves as a personal organizer.
- **Target Audience**: Individuals looking for an all-in-one digital assistant to manage daily tasks, automate processes, and provide reminders through a conversational interface.

## 2. Project Scope
- **Core Features**:
  - Voice and text command recognition
  - Task automation for reminders, scheduling, notifications
  - File handling (uploading and interpreting documents)
  - Personalized responses and task tracking
  - Contextual command understanding

- **Secondary Features**:
  - Assistant chat interface for user interactions
  - Visual Task List and scheduler
  - Customizable themes (Blue for males, Pink for females)

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**:
  - Login and registration with options for Google or Apple authentication.
  - User data synchronization and storage options (cloud or device-based).

- **Command Processing**:
  - **Voice Command Recognition**: Integration of voice APIs for accurate transcription (Google Speech-to-Text or Apple's speech recognition).
  - **Text Command Processing**: Text input to interpret user tasks.
  - **NLP Processing**: Integrate NLP model (Dialogflow, Rasa, or Hugging Face) for understanding natural language instructions.
  - **Task Interpreter**: Convert commands like "Remind me to buy groceries tomorrow" into actionable tasks.

- **Task Automation**:
  - **Scheduling and Reminders**: Integration with Google Calendar, reminders, and notifications.
  - **Communication Management**: Automation of sending messages, emails, and making calls.
  - **Smart Device Control** (Optional): If Android, use Accessibility API for basic controls (launching apps, adjusting settings).

- **Assistant Chat Interface**:
  - Interactive conversation with the assistant.
  - Clarification queries if commands are ambiguous.
  - Task confirmations and reminders in chat form.

- **File Management**:
  - **Document Upload**: Drag-and-drop or select files (supports PDFs, DOCX, CSV, JSON).
  - **Content Parsing**: Basic content processing for user insights from uploaded files.

- **Theme Customization**:
  - **Gender-Based Themes**: Default theme options—Blue for males, Pink for females—with personalization option.
  - **Accessibility Features**: Font size adjustment, high-contrast mode.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Quick response times (target under 1 second per query).
  - High availability and uptime (99.9%).

- **Security**:
  - Encryption of user data, especially sensitive information (personal details, calendar events).
  - Access control for sensitive features, such as messaging or calls.

- **Scalability**:
  - Ability to handle increasing data load as more tasks are scheduled.
  - Adaptable to additional features, such as integration with third-party apps.

## 5. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (for serverless processing), AWS S3 (file storage), Firebase (authentication)
- **Frontend**: React Native (cross-platform compatibility for iOS and Android)
- **APIs**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Dialogflow (or Rasa) for NLP, Calendar APIs, File Processing APIs
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore or AWS DynamoDB for task storage and management

## 6. Cost Estimate
- **Development**:
  - **App Development**: $10,000 - $15,000 for basic MVP functionality
  - **API Integration**: $3,000 - $5,000 for NLP and scheduling APIs
  - **UI/UX Design**: $2,000 - $3,500 for professional design (themes, responsiveness)
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **AWS Services (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB)**: $50 - $100/month (depending on usage)
  - **Google Cloud API Costs**:
    - Speech-to-Text API: $1.44 per hour of audio processing
    - Dialogflow (NLP): Free for standard plan; Enterprise plan starts at $0.002 per request
- **Maintenance**: $500/month (covering updates, minor fixes, and infrastructure adjustments)

- **Total Estimated Cost (Initial)**: $15,550 - $23,600

## 7. User Interface (UI) Design
- **Color Scheme**:
  - **Male Theme**: Blue shades, modern and sleek design.
  - **Female Theme**: Pink shades, soft and minimalistic.

- **Core UI Elements**:
  - Command Input Bar
  - Assistant Chat Window
  - Visual Task List (interactive and draggable tasks)
  - File Upload Section
  - Settings (for theme selection and profile)

## 8. Project Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Requirement Gathering and Design (1-2 Weeks)
- **Phase 2**: API Integration and Basic Functionality (3-4 Weeks)
- **Phase 3**: NLP and Voice Command Processing Integration (3 Weeks)
- **Phase 4**: UI Design and Theme Customization (2 Weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Testing and Deployment (2 Weeks)
- **Total Estimated Timeline**: 10-12 Weeks

## 9. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: For each feature (command processing, task scheduling, file management).
- **Integration Testing**: API integrations, task automation, NLP.
- **User Testing**: With a beta group to gather feedback on usability and UI theme options.
- **Performance Testing**: For response time and load handling.

## 10. Deployment Strategy
- **App Store Deployment**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.
